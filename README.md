# ForestGift - Sustainable Gifting & Forest Monitoring Dashboard

ForestGift is a comprehensive multi-role dashboard system designed to manage large-scale reforestation efforts and sustainable gifting. The platform connects Citizens, NGOs, and Cake Vendors under a unified administrative umbrella to ensure transparent tree plantation and celebration.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The platform supports four distinct user roles:
1. **Admin**: Manages the entire ecosystem, monitors NGOs, assigns plantation tasks, and handles global finances.
2. **Citizen (User)**: Tracks their tree plantation progress, views certificates, and manages their contributions.
3. **NGO**: Receives plantation assignments, updates live progress, and submits growth reports.
4. **Cake Vendor**: Manages celebratory gifting allocations for birthdays and events associated with the plantation project.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Three.js (for immersive 3D background), Leaflet (for maps), Recharts (for analytics).
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose).
